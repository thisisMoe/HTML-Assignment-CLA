      The FIFA World Cup, often simply called the World Cup, is an international
      association football competition contested among the senior men's national
      teams of the 211 members[1] by the sport's global governing body -
      Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). The tournament
      has been held every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930,
      except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held because of the Second World
      War. The reigning champions are Argentina, who won their third title at
      the 2022 tournament.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <h4>Main article: History of the FIFA World Cup</h4>
    <h5>Previous international competitions</h5>
    <p>
      The world's first international football match was a challenge match
      played in Glasgow in 1872 between Scotland and England.[8] The first
      international tournament for nations, the inaugural British Home
      Championship, took place in 1884 which included games between England,
      Scotland, Wales and Ireland.[9] As football grew in popularity in other
      parts of the world at the start of the 20th century, it was held as a
      demonstration sport with no medals awarded at the 1900 and 1904 Summer
      Olympics (however, the International Olympic Committee has retroactively
      upgraded their status to official events), and at the 1906 Intercalated
      Games.[10]
    </p>

    <p>
      After FIFA was founded in 1904, it tried to arrange an international
      football tournament between nations outside the Olympic framework in
      Switzerland in 1906. These were very early days for international
      football, and the official history of FIFA describes the competition as
      having been a failure.[11]
